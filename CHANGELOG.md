### Added

- `rabbithole::model::query::Query` model for 
  - [Inclusion of Related Resources](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes)
  - [Sparse Fields Set](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets)
  - [Pagination](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination)
  - [Filtering](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-filtering)
- `My final goal to this project` in `README.md`
- Basic actix_web support (see `examples/mock_gen.rs` for more details)
- An actix-web based web server
  - A example project showing the basic features
- A lot more tests
- A Rule System ready for the different operations when the jsonapi version changes

### Changed

- Mark the `impl<T: Entity> Entity for Vec<T>` as `unstable-vec-to-document`
- Change `to_document` to longer `to_document_automatically` to encourage users using their own version, rather than the auto version for better performance
- Split `Entity` into `Entity` and `SingleEntity`, where:
  - `SingleEntity` has all of the params like `ty()`, `id()` where only the single entity will have
  - `Entity` defines the more general functions like `included` and `to_document_automatically`, where `Vec<T>` or `[T]` will also have. But of course, they have no the param like `id`
- Error System now is much better now
